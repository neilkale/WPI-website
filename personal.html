		<p>When faced with the question “Who am I”, my mind swirls to find
			an answer. The first place I look is on my stats sheet: My name is
			_____, my race is _____, and my gender is _____. The problem is, this
			description only tells you what I am. Even if all these details
			changed, who I am would stay the same. My stats don’t define my
			identity, and they can even add unnecessary bias. Suppose a person
			had a sibling with my name – it’s possible that their relationship
			with him or her might change their opinion of me! Their sibling and I
			share nothing but a tag; for better or for worse, I might be very
			different from him/her, and any connection is undeserved. Some may
			argue that stats can affect our life experiences. Agreed, each gender
			and race has different life experiences, but so does each individual.
			It’s these individual variations in experience that truly define us.
		</p>

		<p>With that in mind, I return to the question, “Who am I”? The
			next easiest way to define myself is by what I like to do: I play
			(the) ______, my favorite subject is ______, and my favorite author
			is ______. These “All About Me” stats are more personal than the last
			set. They are part of my life experience, and hint at my identity.
			Nevertheless, they’re still statistics. For example, knowing these
			facts might help people decide whether they have common interests
			with me, but it could never help them decide whether they want to be
			my friend.</p>

		<p>The simple solutions fall through, but I must learn the answer.
			“Who am I?” I’ll define myself in the only way left - with my ideas
			and beliefs: I’m eager to explore what I don’t know, and push back
			that boundary. I believe the point of life is to have a good time,
			and I think the only way to do so is to consistently follow your
			moral framework. My morals define me, and I won’t sacrifice my
			framework to imitate others’ success. I do find it tough to do things
			my own way especially when other people are doing them better, but I
			don’t worry about being the best; I simply strive to become a better
			me. Ultimately, I live for the beauty of life, and I try to find it
			in every moment I can. The beauty of friendship, of nature, of music,
			of love. Life is my Eden. I’ve only been here a second, and soon I’ll
			be gone. But just for now, I’ll enjoy the cool evening breeze on my
			face, the coo-coo-roo of the mourning dove, and the scent of jasmine
			blossoms drifting in from the setting sun.</p>
